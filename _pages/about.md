How do our minds and bodies react to specific events? How can we deepen our understanding of "people" within a people-oriented development strategy? These questions have inspired my research journey and continue to drive my research. I explore how traffic participants perceive and interact with their environments and the role subtle interventions can play in transforming human-environment interactions. My ultimate goal is to promote transportation equity, diversity, and sustainability in urban settings.

My research interest lies at the intersection of human behavior, urban environments, and sustainable transportation. Witnessing the disparities in human-environment interactions across regions have inspired me to explore agent-based modeling techniques to simulate behavior patterns. Yet, it was during my work at third-tier cities in China and Kiribati that I realized that some challenges in transportation equity require in-depth academic research and collaboration with scholars, beyond what can be addressed through practical fieldwork alone. 

# What I do?
## Research
My research began during my undergraduate studies at Sun Yat-Sen University, where I investigated taxi refusal behavior across different scenarios under the mentorship of Dr. DENG Yuanchang. Given the randomness in driver, the factors influencing taxi refusal vary significantly. My research sought to uncover common patterns behind their minds. By conducting on-board interviews, questionnaires, and field observations, I uncovered patterns in drivers’ choices, particularly their tendency to refused passengers with disabilities, intoxicated passengers, and those traveling to remote destinations. I developed a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of passenger refusal in different situations for better monitoring and management of the taxi industry. This project, which earned a best thesis award, marked my first experience designing and executing a study independently, encompassing the full research process—from designing and conducting field interviews and questionnaires to ground surveys and building models.

When the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted fieldwork, I took a strategic shift and pivoted to exploring physiological reactions to external events. Collaborating with a PhD in bioengineering and a data analytics postdoctoral researcher, we investigated the physiological mechanism of drowsiness. Despite few studies have analyzed the physiological mechanism of drowsiness, we filled the gap by exploring body reactions under drowsiness and developed an algorithm to detect driving drowsiness. This effort resulted in two published papers, A Hybrid Model Utilizing Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks for Driving Drowsiness Detection and Driving Fatigue Identification Based on Multiple Non-intrusive Indicators (awarded the Best Paper at the 6th International Conference of Transportation and Information Systems). These experiences taught me how to translate raw physiological data into meaning insights, broadening my perspective on how to study human-environment interactions. 

## Projects
Seeking to apply my research in real-world contexts, I joined the [Institute for Transportation and Policy (ITDP)](http://www.itdp-china.org/enteam/?lang=1) and worked on a public transit planning and tactical urbanism project in Kiribati. This island nation in the South Pacific faces unique challenges due to its limited financial resources and undeveloped transportation system. Leading a ground with nine locals, I analyzed data to propose a low-cost public transit reform plan and tactical urbanism pilot. By modifying policy and a tactical urbanism pilot with limited resources, we achieved immediate improvement in mobility for residents without private vehicles. Presenting these findings to policymakers from the Pacific Islands, underscored the critical role of equitable transportation in fostering sustainable development.

I have conducted transportation research in China, Georgia, Indonesia, Kiribati, Colombia, and other countries. My work includes leading low-carbon transportation planning projects and supporting countries in the Global South in their transition to sustainable, low-carbon transport systems.
