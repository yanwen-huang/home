excerpt: 'The increase in car ownership causes traffic and environmental problems in cities around the world.Parking pricing is a sufficient method to reduce unnecessary private vehicle use and encourage public transport development,which can balance the supply and demand and improve air quality.The present study endeavours to investigate the influence of parking pricing on private vehicle utilization and the corresponding shift towards public transport adoption.To this end,a generalized-cost-based method was proposed and applied to the city of Yichang as an illustrative case for analysis.The empirical findings of the investigation demonstrate that the current parking fee of 3.5 CNY per hour in Yichang has indeed exerted a positive impact,causing approximately 32.08%of drivers to transition using public transport.Nevertheless,this percentage falls notably below that observed in other Chinese and international cities,indicating the potential for further optimization.To augment the effectiveness of the parking pricing scheme,it is suggested that Yichang considers a substantial increase in the hourly parking fee,ranging from 7 to 11 CNY.Such a measure is projected to elicit a more substantial behavioural shift,with an estimated 50%to 100%of the increment would appear in the public transport share.In addition to its practical implications,the proposed generalized-cost-based method can serve as a tool for governmental entities,aiding in the adjustment of parking pricing strategies and enabling more targeted policy adjustments.
