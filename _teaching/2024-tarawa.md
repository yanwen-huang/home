**I. Research Design and Team Coordination**

As the Project Manager for the Public Transport Passenger Demand Insights in Kiribati - Tarawa, I took on the crucial task of formulating a comprehensive research strategy. A mixed - method research approach was meticulously designed, encompassing an interview guide, a questionnaire, and a detailed research plan. This approach was tailored to capture a multi - faceted understanding of public transport passenger demand in the region.

In the execution phase, I coordinated a team of 12 local investigators. Given the cross - cultural nature of the research, effective communication and cultural sensitivity were paramount. I ensured that the investigators were well - trained to conduct interviews in a manner that respected local customs and norms, thus facilitating the collection of accurate and valuable data.

**II. Data Analysis Leveraging AI**

To extract meaningful insights from the data, I harnessed the power of artificial intelligence. Over 50 structural interviews conducted in Kiribati were semantically coded and analyzed using advanced AI techniques. Through this process, five major factors that significantly influenced public transport satisfaction were identified. 

Among these factors, a critical pain point emerged: a severe imbalance between supply and demand in the middle sections of bus routes. This finding was not only significant in understanding the current state of public transport in Tarawa but also served as a focal point for subsequent improvement strategies.

**III. Route Optimization and Evaluation**

In response to the identified key pain point, I took proactive steps to redefine traffic zones and optimize public transport routes in the Tarawa region. This involved a detailed assessment of population density, travel patterns, and existing infrastructure.

To ensure the effectiveness of the optimized routes, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed. AHP allowed for a systematic evaluation of the benefits of the new routes, considering multiple criteria such as passenger convenience, operational efficiency, and cost - effectiveness. This quantitative evaluation provided a solid foundation for decision - making and the implementation of the optimized routes.

**IV. Stakeholder Collaboration and Implementation**

Recognizing the importance of collaboration in implementing change, I actively engaged with various stakeholders. I coordinated closely with the Kiribati Infrastructure Development Department, sharing research findings and proposed route optimization plans. This collaboration was essential for ensuring that the initiatives were in line with the government's infrastructure development goals.

In addition, I partnered with the World Bank to secure necessary resources and support for the implementation of the public transport route optimization in Kiribati - Tarawa. Through these collaborative efforts, the proposed optimizations were successfully translated into actionable projects, aiming to enhance the public transport experience for the residents of Tarawa.
