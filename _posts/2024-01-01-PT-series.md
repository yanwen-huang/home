China\'s once-bustling public bus systems, the lifeblood of urban
mobility for generations, now navigate a precarious winter. The familiar
rumble of engines and the sight of ubiquitous buses are no longer
symbols of unchallenged dominance but rather emblems of a sector
grappling with profound existential threats. This analysis, drawing from
a comprehensive series on the \"Death and Rebirth of Chinese Ground
Public Transport,\" delves into the intricate web of challenges, with a
keen focus on the fiscal and fare structures that underpin the crisis,
the stark realities of declining ridership and financial distress, and
the transformative strategies essential for its future. For academic
researchers, this is not merely a study of transport economics but a
lens into urban policy, societal change, and technological adaptation in
one of the world\'s most dynamic contexts.

## The Unfolding Crisis: A Multi-Dimensional Diagnosis

The narrative of decline is stark and backed by sobering data. What was
once a cornerstone of daily commutes is now fighting for relevance.
Understanding this descent requires dissecting the myriad pressures,
both external and internal, that have converged to create this perfect
storm.

### The Ridership Exodus and Financial Precipice

The ground beneath traditional bus services has shifted dramatically.
Before 2013, ground public transport commanded an impressive average
modal share of 60%. Fast forward to 2023, and this figure has plummeted
to a mere 14.2%.
This isn\'t just a statistical blip; it\'s a seismic shift reflecting
changing commuter preferences and the rise of alternatives. The
financial ramifications are equally dire. Some local bus groups reported
revenues in 2021-2022 at less than a third of their pre-pandemic norms.
In tourist-dependent cities like Sanya, the phenomenon of \"peak seasons
not being peak, and off-seasons being even bleaker\" became a harsh
reality. Cases of suspended bus routes and delayed driver salaries in
multiple cities across China, from Sichuan to Guangdong, underscore the
depth of the financial abyss.

### Unpacking the Decline: A Confluence of Factors

The erosion of bus ridership is not attributable to a single cause but
rather a confluence of external pressures and inherent systemic
weaknesses. The rise of shared mobility services has been a significant
disruptor. By 2021, China\'s shared bicycle users reached 300 million,
while ride-hailing platforms boasted over 400 million users, capturing
31.9% of the total taxi transport volum.
The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst, accelerating the shift
towards private vehicle ownership, perceived as safer and more hygienic.
Household car ownership surged from 37.1 vehicles per 100 households in
2020 to 60 in 2022. An ITDP survey in 2020 found that only 34% of
previous metro and bus users maintained their transport mode
post-reopening, with a significant 40% migrating to private cars, taxis,
or ride-hailing.

Beyond these external shocks, the bus system\'s own limitations have
made it less competitive. Reliability is a key concern, with real-time
information platforms often proving inaccurate during peak hours and an
average wait time of 20 minutes if a bus is missed. Operational
efficiency is hampered by strict speed limits (often 40 km/h generally,
and as low as 10-15 km/h at turns) and short inter-stop distances
(300-500m in urban areas), leading to slow journey times and the moniker
\"mobile roadblocks\".
In this environment, alternatives like shared bikes (1.5km average ride,
equivalent to 3-4 bus stops) and e-bikes (around 5km ride, 10-15 bus
stops) offer greater flexibility and comparable, if not superior,
overall travel efficiency for shorter distances.

## The Fiscal Tightrope: Fares, Subsidies, and the Quest for Sustainability

At the heart of the public bus crisis lies a complex fiscal challenge.
The traditional model of low fares, heavily reliant on government
subsidies, is proving unsustainable. This section dissects the acute
dilemmas surrounding fare adjustments and the urgent need for subsidy
reform, drawing on international comparisons and innovative models.

### The Price Conundrum: To Adjust or Not to Adjust?

The debate over bus fares is a global one: should fares be raised to
fund service improvements, or kept low to preserve ridership? Chinese
public bus fares have remained remarkably low, despite significant GDP
growth. Internationally, it\'s recognized that public transport fares
should constitute around 8% of per capita disposable income; in most
Chinese cities, this figure languishes below 4%.
For instance, in Guangzhou, a 2 RMB bus fare represents about 4.5% of
hourly per capita disposable income, whereas in London, a £2 fare
equates to 12.5%.
Even Shenzhen\'s 2019 policy capped commute costs at 6% of disposable
income. This persistent low-fare regime has crippled bus operators\'
revenue, hindering their capacity to upgrade services or fleets and
fostering a deep dependency on fiscal subsidies.

The call for dynamic pricing mechanisms, supported by national
directives like the 2023 \"Opinions,\" offers a pathway forward. This
isn\'t simply about \"dynamic price hikes\" but sophisticated
\"adjustments\". Singapore\'s Public Transport Council (PTC) provides a
compelling model. The PTC annually reviews fares using a formula
incorporating inflation, wages, energy costs, a productivity extraction
(rewarding efficiency with potential for lower fares), and a network
capacity factor. This approach allows for timely responses to rising
operational costs and can be more palatable to the public than
infrequent, large hikes.
Transparency in communicating these adjustments is also crucial.
However, dynamic pricing must be paired with fare stabilization
policies, such as fare caps (e.g., the UK\'s £2 single fare cap) or
tiered discounts for frequent users, to protect vulnerable groups and
maintain the public-good nature of transit.

### Rethinking Fiscal Support: Beyond the Blank Check

The reliance on hefty government subsidies (estimated at 80-120 billion
RMB annually nationwide.
has inadvertently suppressed the intrinsic motivation of bus companies
to improve service quality. A simple reduction in subsidies could,
paradoxically, worsen the situation by forcing service cuts. Instead, a
paradigm shift in how subsidies are allocated is imperative. One
proposed approach involves implementing a service-quality-based scoring
mechanism, where subsidies are granted based on performance assessments.

A more radical, yet potentially more sustainable, long-term strategy
involves transitioning away from general fare subsidies towards targeted
user subsidies. This could mean providing tiered financial assistance
based on income levels or residential areas, ensuring affordability for
those who need it most. The \"Opinions\" also suggest replacing blanket
elderly fare concessions with direct comprehensive allowances for
seniors, which could reduce overall public expenditure while ensuring
benefits reach the intended recipients.

Such reforms aim to empower bus companies to generate revenue through
fare adjustments reflecting service value, while safeguarding social
equity.

## Charting the Future: Towards a Resilient and Responsive Public Transit Ecosystem

The future of China\'s ground public transport hinges on its ability to
transform from a conventional service provider into an agile,
data-informed, and user-centric mobility partner. This requires a
multi-pronged strategy involving technological adoption, service
diversification, and robust governmental support.

### The Data-Driven Revolution and User-Centricity

Data is the new fuel. Bus companies possess a wealth of information from
GPS trackers (stop times, average speeds) and smart card transactions
(passenger origins/destinations, travel frequency). Analyzing this data
can reveal crucial insights into travel patterns, popular destinations,
and peak demand times, enabling precise adjustments to routes and
service frequencies.
analysis to tailor services for industrial park employees, including
aligning with metro times and using different vehicle sizes, exemplifies
a successful data-driven, user-focused approach.

Beyond operational data, the integration of demographic, meteorological,
and socio-economic data can unlock deeper understanding of passenger
behavior. This holistic view supports the development of highly
customized services, such as responsive bus systems. Several Chinese
cities, including Guangzhou and Nanning, have already piloted responsive
stopping services in 2023, allowing buses to skip stops with no waiting
passengers or disembarkation requests, thereby improving efficiency.
A scientific customer development model involves segmenting users (e.g.,
commuters, elderly accessing healthcare, occasional travelers),
tailoring services and promotions, and cultivating loyalty to stem
ridership loss and attract new users.

### Embracing Integration and Innovation

The siloed approach to public transport is obsolete. The future lies in
integration -- with shared mobility, other public transport modes, and
even broader lifestyle services. Bus groups can actively collaborate
with shared bike companies to provide first/last-mile connectivity,
potentially leasing idle land near bus stops for bike parking,
generating ancillary revenue and boosting bus ridership.
The concept of \"Mobility-as-a-Service\" (MaaS), integrating different
transport modes into a single platform for planning, booking, and
payment, is a crucial step.

Looking further, the evolution towards \"Life-as-a-Service\" (LaaS)
envisages integrating mobility with other daily needs like dining,
shopping, and entertainment, akin to how platforms like Meituan and
Douyin are expanding their service ecosystems.
Automation also presents transformative potential. By the end of 2023,
China already had over 200 autonomous city buses in operation, primarily
in pilot short-haul routes.
While driverless shuttles promise cost savings (driver labor can be
50-70% of operating costs) and enhanced accessibility, significant
technological and economic hurdles remain for widespread adoption,
especially in diverse urban and rural settings.

### The Indispensable Role of Governance and Policy

Transformation cannot be shouldered by bus operators alone. Proactive
and supportive government policies are critical. This includes the
strict implementation of bus priority measures -- dedicated lanes,
signal priority, and, where appropriate, easing restrictive speed limits
to enhance operational efficiency and reliability.
Furthermore, local governments must champion a competitive yet
cooperative environment among transport providers, encouraging data
sharing and joint planning.

Long-term strategic planning is essential. The \"Green Transport 14th
Five-Year Development Plan\" aims for over 60% of cities with
populations exceeding one million to achieve a 70% green travel ratio by
2025, while the \"Comprehensive Transport System Plan\" emphasizes bus
priority.
Achieving these ambitious targets requires significant investment in
infrastructure and policy reforms, including measures to internalize the
external costs of private car use (e.g., through parking fees or
congestion charging). Adapting to societal trends like aging populations
by planning integrated elderly-friendly communities that are well-served
by public transport will also be key.

## Conclusion: A Call for Scholarly Engagement

The predicament of China\'s public bus sector is a multifaceted
challenge demanding innovative solutions grounded in rigorous research.
From optimizing fare structures and subsidy mechanisms to harnessing the
power of data and fostering integrated mobility ecosystems, the path to
revival is complex but not insurmountable. For academic researchers,
this evolving landscape offers fertile ground for inquiry into urban
transport policy, behavioral economics, sustainable development, and the
socio-technical transitions shaping modern cities. The journey ahead
will require a concerted effort from policymakers, operators, and the
research community to ensure that public buses can once again serve as
efficient, equitable, and sustainable pillars of urban life.
