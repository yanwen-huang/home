excerpt: This blog introduces Jinan's effort on decarbonization in urban transport field. Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, has transformed its public transport by integrating a new dual-power **trolleybus** system into its existing **Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)** network. This innovative project, supported by a $336 million loan from the Asian Development Bank, aims to combat traffic congestion and reduce emissions. These modern trolleybuses can run on both overhead wires and battery power, offering greater flexibility and lower operational costs. The initiative is a cornerstone of the city’s broader low-emission zone strategy, which also includes improving walking and cycling networks. By 2023, Jinan’s green travel mode share had reached over 75%.
